## What it does

### The Plenty of Flicks App

> We all know the struggle. You sit down to watch a movie with a group of friends or significant other, and spend more time picking out a suitable flick than actually watching the movie. Enter Plenty of Flicks. Users can explore available movies on three supported subscription services (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu), and add movies to their watchlist. When it's time to watch, users create a party with the group they want to watch with, and voila: PoF presents a list of movies they ALL want to watch.

### The Plenty of Flicks BE Repo

> The Plenty of Flicks FE Repo utilizes the custom endpoints created by the BE repo to create a versatile client-facing web application. With the repo, users can log in/out with Google Omniauth, add movies from Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video to their watchlists, add friends, create groups, and view shared watchlists.
> Please [visit the Plenty of Flicks FE Repo here](https://github.com/plenty-of-flicks/plenty_of_flicks_fe).

### GET /api/v1/services/update_availability

GET /api/v1/services/update_availability - clears the BE movie availabilities table (joins table between services and movies that signifies which movies are available on each service) of all entries of the given service, then repopulates the table with the service's current availabilties as per the Watchmode API. This method, though inefficient, was chosen due to endpoint limitations of the Watchmode API. Background workers are used here, as the endpoint can take a long time to process.

#### Request Parameters

|     Name        |      Type     |   Description                                                                                               |

|  service        |  String       |   (required) - the name of the service to be updated (netflix, hulu, or amazon)                             |

#### Sample Response

```

    "id":null,
    "type":"service_refresh",
    "attributes": {
      "name":"Hulu",
      "movie_count":2010
    }
  }
}
```

### GET /api/v1/movies/populate_details

GET /api/v1/movies/populate_details - searches through the movies table for entries with missing information. For each such movie, the BE makes an API call to TMDB API to fetch the movie's details, then updates the database's movie entry with the fetched data. Background workers are used here, as the endpoint can take a long time to process.

#### Sample Response

```
{
  "movies_updated":3,
  "update_status":"Complete - incomplete movies have been populated."
}
```
